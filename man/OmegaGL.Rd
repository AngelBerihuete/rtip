\title{Matrix for testing Generalized Lorenz dominance}
\usage{
OmegaGL(dataset, samp)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{a data.frame containing variables obtained by using the setupDataset function.}

\item{samp}{an integer which represents the number of the GL ordinates to be estimated. These ordinates will be estimated at points \eqn{p_i}, where \eqn{p_i=i/samp, \quad i=1, \dots, samp}.}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:

Omega covariance matrix for the estimated vector of GL curve ordinates.

gl.curve estimated vector of GL curve ordinates.

p_i vector with components p_i=i/samp, i=1, ..., samp.

quantile_i estimated vector of quantiles of income corresponding to these p_i's.

gamma.i vector of estimated conditional means of income less than the quantil corresponding to p_i=i/samp, i=1, ..., samp.
}
\description{
The auxiliary function OmegaGL computes the (empirical) vector of Generalized Lorenz (GL) curve ordinates and its corresponding covariance matrix. This matrix will be used to compute the test-statistic to test for the Generalized Lorenz dominance relation between two GL curves.
}
\details{
Estimation of GL curve ordinates and their covariance matrix are calculated following Beach and Davidson (1983).

Calculations are made using the equivalized disposable income. The equivalence scales that can be employed are the modified OECD scale or the parametric scale of Buhmann et al. (1988). The default is the modified OECD scale (see setupDataset).

\examples{
data(eusilc2)
ATdataset <- setupDataset(eusilc2, country = "AT", s = "OECD")
omega.gl <- OmegaGL(ATdataset, samp = 10)
